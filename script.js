// every time a button is pressed i want a random animation of fireworks or meme/anime popping up at random areas on the screen
// and a +5 gold animation coin every time you win, -3 if you lose to make people addicted
// maybe a bonus round of mouse dodging very fast bullets coming out of nowhere like undertale every win
// and then when you win game gets harder, there's a countdown and music and flashing lights
// and the picks keep moving around on the screen HAHA, play again button replaces 3 buttons
// and in 2 wins, let player know the buttons get switched 
// in 3 wins, make play again button 3/4 the screen
